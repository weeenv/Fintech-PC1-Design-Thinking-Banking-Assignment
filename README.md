# Fintech-PC1-Design-Thinking-Banking-Assignment

This is a powerpoint presentation what my three other group members and I did for the final project for the FinTechSG Programme Professional Certificate Level 1.
The presentation is regarding the introduction of digital transformation in the Singapore financial and banking scene and how we can improve the interface and features of DBS Paylah App to improve the user experience.
